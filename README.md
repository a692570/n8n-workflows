# üß† n8n Workflow Collection

This repository contains a collection of **n8n workflows** gathered from multiple sources, including:

* Workflows exported from the [n8n.io](https://n8n.io) website and community forum
* Publicly shared examples found across the web (GitHub, blogs, etc.)

The goal is to provide a useful resource for inspiration, learning, and reuse in your own n8n projects.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

* Each `.json` file represents a single exported workflow.
* Files are named either based on their original title or source.
* You may also find `.txt` files that were converted into `.json` (see below).

---

## üîÑ TXT to JSON Conversion

Some workflows were originally saved as `.txt` files or copied from online sources. A script was used to:

* Detect `.txt` files
* Attempt to parse them as JSON or structured key-value pairs
* Convert them to valid `.json` format

If you‚Äôre looking to run the conversion yourself, check out `convert_txt_to_json.py` included in this repo.

## üóÇ Renaming Workflows

A helper script `rename_workflows.py` is provided to standardize file names.
It reads the `name` field from each workflow JSON and renames the file to a
sanitized version of that value (or falls back to the first node name when the
workflow has no title).

Run the script with:

```bash
python rename_workflows.py
```

After running the script, review and commit the renamed files so the repository
stays consistent.
